<p>Since MIS is 'for the' management it is imperative that it also should have a very strong 'by the' management initiative. Management is involved in the designing process of MIS and also in its continuous review and up gradation to develop a good qualitative system. The system is structured as per directions factored by management. This helps in minimizing the gap between expectations of management form the system and the actual system.  </p>
